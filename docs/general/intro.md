Welcome to the LotusEngine documentation site.  We are in the process of launching publicly so these docs are a work in progress aimed at giving you an idea of what is to come!

LotusEngine is best defined as an app/service builder for ecommerce/marketing. It lets developers wireframe the flow between various API and eases the pain points of doing so by providing standard constructs such as webhooks, storage, triggers etc... These wireframe are known as _workflows_ and can be created using a simple JSON/YAML file or through the UI.
