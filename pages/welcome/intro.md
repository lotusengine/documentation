# Overview

## What is LotusEngine?

LotusEngine is an API integration platform designed to reduces boilerplate and accelerates development. 

- Build and run complex automations
- React on real-time and aggregated data
- Extend core capabilities with custom JavaScript
- Design basic user interfaces



Out of the box LotusEngine aims to address common API connectivity challenges such as:

- Throttling, looping and parallel automations
- Custom user interfaces
- React on real-time and historical data

## Is LotusEngine for Me?

LotusEngine is perfect for developers seeking to quickly scaffold API integrations, especially those servicing non-technical users that may require a customizable user-interface. 

Trigger Workflows on:
- HTTP requests
- On schedule
- Events such as real time or aggregated data
- Through the API

Data can be stored, filtered and aggregated using collections:
- Provide searchable data
- React on real time values
- Take informed action using aggregated over time values

## How does LotusEngine Work?

LotusEngine provides a framework to rapidly build automations, such as API integrations. Created through the Typescript SDK, CLI toolbelt, or dashboard UI; workflows let you write custom code, connect to 3rd party services, and define reactions to pre-determined data signals, like real-time or aggregated data.

## Use Cases

LotusEngine aids clients from start to finish. Read how our custom flow solution worked in the following use case:

SHOPIFY TO QUICKBOOKS - CUSTOM FLOW

The Requirements: 
1) A custom API integration tool that created invoices and updated inventory in Quickbooks, everytime an order took place on Shopify. 
2) If the product information was incomplete, the client was to be notified and capable of pausing orders to contact the customer. 

The Problem: 
1) Existing integrations assume the product exists in QuickBooks (QB). If the product is missing and they are unable to fulfill the requirement of Cost of Good necessary to ensure accurate Profit & Loss statement. 
2) Traditional solution involves launching a custom server, database and creating a non-trivial email/pause automation system.

The LotusEngine Solution:
- Built in webhook handling (ability to listen to incoming order notifications).
- Recognizes and transforms Shopify data into a common unified format.
- Leverages existing QuickBooks connections available from community created modules.
- Built in functionality to pause a workflow and wait for manual input/approval.

Bullet points:
- integrates API quickly
- simple UI for end users
- searchable data
- react on real time and aggregated data
- expandable using NodeJS custom modules
- low code development of workflow automations


It aims to eliminate boilerplate and solves common problems.

Problems it solves:
- No more boilerplate code
- Built in workflow actions handle standard needs such as authentication, requests, throttling etc


Workflows can be triggered on:
- HTTP requests
- On schedule
- Events such as real time or aggregated data
- Through the API

Data can be stored, filtered and aggregated using collections:
- Provide searchable data
- React on real time values
- React on aggregated over time values

Services represent a set of workflow automations, data collections and UI views that work together as a standalone app. They can be deployed through a Typescript SDK and a CLI toolbelt as well as through the web dashboard. They can be shared.

Expandable and shareable
Since services are all or mostly configuration based they are easily shareable and modifiable.
