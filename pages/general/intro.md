Welcome to the LotusEngine documentation site. We are in the process of launching publicly so these docs are a work in progress aimed at giving you an idea of what is to come.

## What is LotusEngine

LotusEngine can be summarized as _reactive ecommerce analytics_. In short it allows you to collect any kind of ecommerce and marketing data such as orders, leads, visits and so on and react to any signal or insight on this data with complex automations called _workflows_. These _workflows_ can be created using through the dashboard UI or with our developer tools and define how to react to these signals. Workflows let you write custom code, connect to 3rd party services and so on.

Take a look at the concepts page for a deeper understanding.
